            <h1>Provenance Segment Visualization</h1>
            <h3>Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Data from provenance logs are segmented. Small segments (<25s long) are grouped into the preceeding segment. Only "interesting" action types from the logs are regarded in summarizing each segment.</p>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Each segment is represented by a card, featuring the PID and segment number it represents. A green bar represents the timeline for the entire segment, with a dark green block showing the relative start and end times for the segment. The length of this bar encodes the duration of the segment. Key information about searching, note taking, highlighting, and document moving is included. Bars showing the relative frequency of each action are shown for each segment. A "Total" activity bar shows how much of the total activity occurs in the segment.</p>

            <h3>Zoom/Filter</h3>
            <p> Nothing present for this. Doesn't seem like its necessary really at the moment.</p>

            <h3>Details on Demand</h3>
            <p> Hovering over the timeline shows precises start, end, and duration times. Incomplete notes/highlights can be hovered to show the entire text. Hovering over each bar displays all the interactions of the type from that segment and is linked to highlight corresponding interactions from other segments and shows their frequency. A list of all actions with frequencies is provided</p>

            <h3 style="color:darkgreen">Updates</h3>
            <p style="color:darkgreen">
              <b>1. Time updated to a bar on each segment. Details available on hover.</b><br>
              &nbsp;Idea: shows positioning/duration in entire investigation visually.<br>
              <b>2. Text cleaned up + styled for keywords/phrases. Hovering shows whole text if it is too big.</b><br>
              &nbsp;Limitation: text has to be on one line otherwise the style breaks because svg text is bad when you want to wrap and have interactions in the text.<br>
              <b>3. Better tooltips for interaction bars: shows quantity of each item (i.e. if something was searched for or a document was moved multiple times. </b><br>
              <b>4. Bug fixing/refactored stuff for modularity.</b><br>
            </p>
            <h3 style="color:red">TODO</h3>
            <p style="color:red">
              <b>1. Add symbols for actions</b><br>
              <b>2. Still try different resegmentation techniques? Or just assume later better segments will be provided?</b><br>
              <b>3. Actual controls for loadings different datasets, sorting, filtering, etc.?</b><br>
              <b>4. Larger view for a card/actual timeline view of actions similar to the other tools?</b><br>
