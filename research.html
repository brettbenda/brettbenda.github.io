        <p class="text-dark text-left">My current research focuses on human perception of hand placement and movement in virtual reality. Previously, I have worked on projects involving multimodal interactions with virtual agents and attitudes towards biometric authentication with smart home devices.</p>

        <h4 class="text-dark text-left">Investigation of Perceptible Scaled and Offset Hand Placement in VR</h4>
        <p class="text-dark text-left">Hands are commonly used by users to interact with their environment in virtual reality. Is is common that objects in a virtual scene may be placed outside the user's normal reach, so hand movements are sometimes amplified or moved to allow futher reach. If natural and immersive environments are the goal of VR developers, than these modifications should be kept to an undetectable magnitude. This research seeks to identify ranges of acceptable values for scaled and offset hand movements before they are perceptible to users in VR.</p>

        <h4 class="text-dark text-left">Effects of Initial Explanations on User Trust in Machine Learning</h4>
        <p class="text-dark text-left">Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized in the fields such as medicine, automation, and policing. Often, they are used to recommend courses of action or identify important features of an input (i.e. possible pedestrians in front of a self-driving car). For end-users, it is important to know <i>why</i> a system determined its output. This is often implemented in the form of an human-friendly explanation understandable by those with domain-specific knowledge, but not prior experience with machine learning. This work seeks to identify how information initially told to users affects their trust in the system.</p>

        <p class="text-dark text-left">Drones are often used in building inspection tasks where humans cannot easily reach an area to be inspected. This project investigated the presentation of drone flight data in order to train novice drone pilots best practices and strategies for drone piloting during building inspection tasks.</p>
        <p class="text-dark text-left">The development and evaluation of this system was conducted as part of CIS6930 Information Visualization during the Fall 2019 semester. </p>
